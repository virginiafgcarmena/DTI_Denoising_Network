FINAL MASTERS PROJECT: Development of a Cardiac Diffusion Tensor Imaging Denoising Neural Network
based on U-NET.
This Project contains:
- Scripts for pre-processing the data and post-processing it (results)
- Denoising UNET neural network training and tuning scripts
- Denoising YNET neural network training and turning scripts

All the images corresponding to the dataset have been erased.
The input to the Network is raw DTI Data from Spin-Echo and STEAM sequences 
collected for 6 encoding directions.
