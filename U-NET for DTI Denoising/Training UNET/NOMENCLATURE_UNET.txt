U-NET WHOLE must be a structure with a vertical concatenation of all the rest of the datasets, not shuffled. 
First column: "noisy" image
Second column: denoised image
Third column: tag identifying (HEALTHY SUBJCT/PATIENT)(SUBJ. NUMBER)(PHASE)(SEQUENCE)(DIRECTION)(Number of Average)
It's different from the others datasets because its minimum values have been all sent to 0 (there were pixel values below 0 and they were sent to 0 value)
The images have also been converted to uint8
This is done with zerobelow0.m.


U_NET RESIDUALS 

U-NET WHOLE with the difference that the gorund truth now is:
"noisy" image - ground truth
